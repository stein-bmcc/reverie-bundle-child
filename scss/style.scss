// Default WordPress CSS classes.

// By default WordPress adds a lot of classes to different UI elements. 
// These partials show them. 
//Uncomment the imports to use one or more of them, or copy from the files to your own styles below.

// @import "style-wp-default/wp-body";
// @import "style-wp-default/wp-comments";
// @import "style-wp-default/wp-post-page";
// @import "style-wp-default/wp-sidebar";


// ==========================================

// Add your Custom CSS here. This is where you add CSS that is specific to your theme and WordPress
// If you are looking to modify the default Foundation styles then start with the _settings.scss file
