/* -------------------------------------------------- 

	This stylesheet will not be loaded by default.
	
	The main stylesheet is located in css/style.css 
	and the Sass file that creates it is scss/style.scss.

	Reverie uses lib/enqueue-style.php to load css/app.css and css/style.css
	The functions.php file loads the lib/enqueue-style.php

	Reverie-Bundle has been modified from the orginal Reverie to include all foundation scss files so that you don't have to have the foundation gem installed to compile the Sass.
	You will need to have Compass installed or a GUI compiler that will compile Compass. Two free options are
	
	Prepros: http://alphapixels.com/prepros/
	Scout: http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/
	
	So you will be able to modify the styles using the files in the scss folder.

  Make sure you have a Sass compiler running and that it is set to watch the files in the scss folder and output to the css folder.
